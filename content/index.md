This website collects writings (at a different stage of development) about all sort of things I fall upon by chance, or look for intentionally. They include **notes** on topics I am trying to learn more about, ***memoranda*** on future projects and activities, **reports** on past experiences, etc. It is intended to be an ever-growing garden: you shouldn't expect to find (a few) tall larks yet, but rather (more and more) small pine sprouts.

The goal is twofold: to build a place where to **keep and save** the things I experience/learn/plan, and at the same time use this place to **build upon** them.

The concept of [[digital garden]], on which this website is based, covers many principles and ideas: some of them are adopted here, but without too much rigor. This garden is *freely* inspired by other projects, most of which are based on the idea of sharing the "gardener's" progress on the web or on the concept of learning in public. This project, however, before being a showcase for my interests and the things I spend my time on, is primarily a way of taking notes and **connecting** together (otherwise isolated) pieces of information, in order to build them up into *knowledge*. Nonetheless, as I constantly benefit of the work shared by other people, I've thought it might be nice to give back to the community by sharing my work too, in case it might be useful to anyone. 

To explore the categories, see all the **[[tags]]**.

To start roaming around the garden, you can use the **global interactive graph** below.

Bear in mind that much of the content on this website will be in Italian. ðŸ™‚
